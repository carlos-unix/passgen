I recognize this isn't the most advanced password generator. The concepts I've used serve to create a simple yet functional tool. While the term "entropy" isn't technically accurate in this script, my primary goal was to make something both useful and straightforward, while also practicing my C++ skills (I'm still learning, so bear with me). If you encounter any issues, have suggestions, or find bugs, please let me know.

## Script usage

```
./passgen -e entropy_level (entropy_level must be between 1 and 100)
./passgen -h (show how to use the script)
```
